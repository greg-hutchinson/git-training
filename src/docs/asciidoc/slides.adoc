Distributed Version Control System

## Git Vs. Sharepoint
- Both are centralized locations for source documents
- Sharepoint only version controls individual files
- Sharing documents with people in the organization that do not have git already is tedious. Everyone has access to Sharepoint

## Git Vs. Sharepoint
- Git works locally and is really fast. Sharepoint is a little sluggish
- Git (in theory) takes an extra step or two to have the most current snapshot (pull, checkout)
- Git is more technical, steeper learning curve but because of this has a lot more features

## Centralized VCS - CVCS
[.column]
[graphviz, cvcs1, png]
----
digraph cvcs {
    size="70!"
    Repository [shape=cylinder, label="Central\nRepository" width=1];
    User1 [shape= rectangle, label="User1\nWorking\nCopy",];
    User2 [shape= rectangle, label="User2\nWorking\nCopy"];

    User1 -> Repository [label="commit"]
    Repository -> User1 [label="check-out"]
    User2 -> Repository [label="commit"]
    Repository -> User2 [label="check-out"]
}
----

[.column]
--
- Always had to be connected to the network 
- Committing changes - released changes (Can't commit in a partial state) 
- Checking-out your local copy possibly destroyed WIP
--

## Why Distributed VCS
- Central shared spot for documents
- Don't have to be connected to the network
- Versions are kept of the entire directory structures (not just individual files)
- Committing changes only affect the local repository. Commit freely and at any time
- Backups are implicit because of cloning
- All history is on the local computer

Let's discuss this in detail

## Terminology
- Remote Repository - The git repository that is hosted in the cloud or on another computer
- Local Repository - The git repository that is hosted on your local computer
- Working Copy - The current checked-out version to your local computer.
- Clone - Clone the *remote repository* and create the *local repository*

## Terminology
- Push - Push all deltas from the **local repository** to the **remote repository**
- Pull - Pull all deltas from the **remote repository** to the **local repository**
- Commit - Commit the changes in the **working copy** to the **local repository**
- Check-out - Replicated the **working copy** with an exact snapshot of this point in time from the **local repository**
