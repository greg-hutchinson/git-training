# Git and Gitkraken
---
## Why Distributed VCS
- Central shared spot for documents
- Can work disconnected from network and then sync when connected
    - With entire history
- Versions entire directory structures (not just individual documents)
- Backups are implicit because of cloning

---
## Comparision Git Vs Sharepoint
- Both are centralized locations for source documents
- Sharepoint only version controls individual files
- Sharing documents with people in the organization that do not have git already is tedious. Everyone has access to Sharepoint
- Git works locally and is really fast. Sharepoint is a little sluggish
- Git (in theory) takes an extra step or two to have the most current snapshot (pull, checkout)
